   ## About   

When dealing with software development, your team may want to generate a webpage that displays my team's basic info
so that I have quick access to each employee's name, role, email, contact info, github profile, ect.  

This software uses node to generate a series of questions for the user to create contact cards for each employee which generate on an HTML page called team.HTML  

   ## Installation   

   This software requires npm installation as well as visual studio code or a similar program.   

   ## Usage  

   To use this software you need visual studio code (or a similar program), NPM and a github account.  
    Once NPM files are installed with your code, run node index.js on the command bar. You will be prompted with a series of questions about the content of your team.HTML. Once you've answered all of the questions the HTML file will automatically generate which you can use for any team project.
